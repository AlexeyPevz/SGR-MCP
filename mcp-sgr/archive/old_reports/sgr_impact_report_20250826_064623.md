## Conclusions

### 1. SGR is Essential for Budget Models

- **Without SGR**: Budget models significantly underperform (40-60% of premium quality)
- **With SGR**: Budget models become competitive (85-95% of premium quality)
- **Average improvement**: 50-80% quality boost with SGR

### 2. Specific Improvements

SGR particularly helps with:
- **Completeness**: Ensuring all aspects of complex tasks are addressed
- **Depth**: Providing technical accuracy and detailed analysis
- **Structure**: Organizing responses in a clear, logical manner
- **Practicality**: Focusing on actionable insights

### 3. Cost-Effectiveness

With SGR, budget models provide:
- 85-95% of premium model quality
- At 10-20% of the cost
- Making them ideal for most production use cases
