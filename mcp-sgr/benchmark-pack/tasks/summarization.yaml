      Incident Report: Authentication Service Outage
      Date: 2024-01-15, Duration: 47 minutes (14:23-15:10 UTC)
      Severity: S1, Affected Users: ~2.3M (15% of user base)
      
      Timeline:
      - 14:23: Alerts triggered for auth service response time >5s
      - 14:25: On-call engineer acknowledged, began investigation
      - 14:30: Identified database connection pool exhaustion
      - 14:35: Attempted to increase pool size, change failed to propagate
      - 14:45: Discovered configuration drift between primary and replica
      - 14:55: Emergency failover to replica cluster
      - 15:05: Service restoration confirmed
      - 15:10: All systems normal, monitoring enhanced
      
      Root Cause:
      A gradual memory leak in the connection pooling library (v2.3.1) caused connections to not be properly released. This was exacerbated by a recent traffic increase (+30% week-over-week). The leak was present for ~2 weeks but only became critical at current traffic levels.
      
      Contributing Factors:
      1. Outdated pooling library with known memory leak (CVE-2023-4521)
      2. Monitoring gap: connection pool metrics not included in dashboards
      3. Configuration management: primary/replica configs not synchronized
      4. Runbook outdated: failover procedure had wrong commands
      
      Impact:
      - Login failures: 100% for affected region
      - API authentication errors: cascading failures in 3 dependent services
      - Data loss: None
      - SLA impact: Monthly uptime dropped to 99.89% (target 99.95%)
      
      Action Items:
      1. IMMEDIATE: Update pooling library to v2.4.3 (P0, assigned: TeamA)
      2. IMMEDIATE: Add connection pool metrics to primary dashboard (P0, assigned: TeamB)
      3. THIS WEEK: Implement config sync validation in CI/CD (P1, assigned: TeamC)
      4. THIS WEEK: Update and test all runbooks (P1, assigned: On-call team)
      5. THIS MONTH: Implement canary deployment for auth service (P2, assigned: Platform team)
      
      Lessons Learned:
      - Need better library dependency tracking and automated CVE scanning
      - Critical metrics must be prominently displayed
      - Regular disaster recovery drills would have caught runbook issues
